# How to Brew French Press Coffee

# Overview

## What is French press coffee?

French press coffee is a drink made from coffee grounds that are brewed in a French press. A French press is a kind of coffee pot that consists of a glass, plastic, or metal beaker and a lid with a plunger fixed to a metal mesh screen.

Coffee grounds are placed on the bottom of the beaker. Hot water is poured over the grounds and allowed to brew for 4 minutes. The plunger is pushed down, separating the coffee grounds from the liquid.

French press coffee is defined by its rich flavor and thick, oily consistency compared to other methods of brewing coffee.

## Differences between French press coffee and drip coffee

Drip coffee is a much more common method of brewing coffee from coffee grounds. In this method, a thin paper coffee filter is laid in the coffee makerâ€™s basket. The filter holds the coffee grounds. Hot water is poured over the grounds in the filter, which then drips slowly into the coffee pot below. This allows for the coffee grounds to brew in the hot water before dripping into the pot. The paper filter absorbs a large amount of the oil that is present in the coffee grounds.

This lack of oil is one of the primary differences between French press coffee and drip coffee. As French presses use a metal mesh screen attached to a plunger instead of a paper filter, the lipid content in French press coffee is much higher. This results in a thick and rich cup of coffee with a visible layer of oil on top.
However, this also leads to a slightly grainier cup of coffee as the coffee grounds remain on the bottom of the beaker, below the mesh filter. Small amounts of the grounds can find their way through the filter and into the drink.

## Materials needed

To begin brewing your French press coffee, you will need:

1. A French press coffee pot
2. Coffee beans (pre-ground coffee can be used, but it is recommended to grind fresh beans)
3. A coffee grinder
4. A pot to boil water, a tea kettle, or an electric kettle
5. A tablespoon measuring cup
6. A cup or mug to pour your coffee into

##Components of a French press
## Beaker

The base of a French press coffee pot is a metal, glass, or plastic cylinder or beaker. It has a pouring spout for dispensing coffee and usually a handle for gripping the pot.

## Lid and plunger

All French presses have a tight-fitting lid with a plunger mechanism going through the center. The plunger is connected to a metal mesh screen at the bottom which acts as a filter to separate the coffee grounds from the liquid coffee. There is a hole on one side of the lid that aligns with the opening on the beaker to allow coffee to pour out after the brewing is done.

# Steps to using your French press


## 1. Grinding your coffee

Grind the coffee beans to a medium coarseness. It is best to grind fresh coffee beans instead of using pre-ground coffee, although you can use pre-ground coffee. French presses work best when the coffee grounds are a medium-coarse consistency. This prevents the grounds from easily penetrating through the mesh filter and making the coffee grainy.

## 2. Measuring your coffee grounds

Measure 2 tablespoons of coffee per 8 ounces of water and pour the grounds onto the bottom of the beaker.
The amount of coffee grounds you need depends on personal preference, but generally, the ratio of coffee grounds to water is about 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per cup (8 ounces) of water. Start by using this standard ratio and adjust it if needed for future brews.

## 3. Heating and pouring your water

Measure the appropriate amount of water for the quantity of grounds used into your pot, kettle, or electric kettle. Remember, the ratio of water is about 8 ounces of water per 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds.

Bring the water to a boil. When the water begins to boil, turn off the heat.

Wait between 30 seconds and 1 minute to allow the water to cool. Boiling water (212 degrees Fahrenheit) is too hot and will burn the coffee, making it bitter and unpleasant. Thirty seconds to 1 minute of cooling will allow it to reach the desired temperature of just under 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

If you are using an electric kettle with temperature settings, select the setting that is closest to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

Once the water has reached the desired temperature, slowly and evenly pour it over the coffee grounds in the beaker. Gently mix the water-coffee mixture with a spoon to evenly distribute the grounds in the water. Place the lid onto the top of the beaker, with the plunger pulled to the topmost position.

## 4. Timing your brew

Set a timer for 4 minutes. Allow the coffee to brew with the lid on for a minimum of 4 minutes.

Some brands or blends of coffee may require some timing adjustment, but it is best to start with a 4-minute brew time and adjust timing as needed in the future.

## 5. Plunging the screen and pouring the coffee

After 4 minutes have passed, gently and slowly push the plunger down. Stop just before the very bottom of the beaker. This step separates the liquid coffee from the coffee grounds and pushes the grounds to the bottom, leaving the delicious, hot coffee at the top. The screen will prevent the grounds from being poured out.

Align the opening of the lid with the open spout of the beaker and pour the coffee into the mug, cup, or thermos. Sip carefully, as the coffee is likely very hot.

# Advanced steps

## Adding extra flavors to your coffee

As with coffee that has been brewed using other methods, there are a number of products that can be added to brewed coffee that will enhance or change its flavor.
Milk, cream, and non-dairy milk alternatives combine well with brewed coffee. The fats in these products will contribute to an even richer, more decadent texture. They also will reduce the often bitter, intense flavor of the coffee.
